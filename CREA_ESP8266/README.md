CREA ESP266 for Arduino UNO
===========================

Simple Library for Arduino UNO and the ESP8266 Wifi Module

Allows the communication with CREA and an Arduino simpler. Just follow the example to understand its use.

Good Luck

ALERT
-----

This library is still very unstable for using with Arduino UNO. Please have a look at it and if you can refactor it, please make a pull request.

TODO'S
------

-	A reconnect function
-	A websocket stream listener (for proper PUB-SUB)
-	Refactor the code as there is still too much dirty code and misused variables around
-	Optimization for Arduino UNO... try to steal no more than the 30% of memory for the library.
